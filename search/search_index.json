Connect Computer to Projector / Sound System Connect your device to the projector / sound system. You do not have to use the projector. You can connect using a 3.5mm audio cable and the jacks on your computer and one of the two jacks in Mackey Hall, or by using HDMI. If you need help with the inputs, see the article entitled \"Input Methods\" . 2. Computer Volume Levels Turn up the volume on the computer to somewhere near 10 (or about 10% of total volume). Any higher of audio become too loud and becomes garbled when put into the system. From here, you will change computer volume levels using the iPad and Master Fader. See the page entitled \"Connecting iPad to Sound System\" for help with getting the iPad connected to the sound system. 3. Master Fader In Master Fader, you will see one of two different slider options. Sometimes the computer sliders (7 & 8) are combined together into one slider, and sometimes they aren't combined. A. Combined Sliders B. Separate Sliders 4. Changing Audio Levels Whether it's using the combined single slider or the two separate sliders, move the slider to the level that you want it at.

Microphone Storage The microphones are either stored in the second from the bottom drawer on the sound system rack or on the top shelf inside of the pulpit. Microphones Mackey hall has various microphones available for use. They are detailed below. Pulpit Microphone The pulpit microphone is designed to plug into the pulpit. There is a cable in the top corner that it plugs into, and then that cable plugs into one of the two ports on the wall under the projector screen. This microphone usually resides in the sound system rack drawer. Wireless Clip-on Lapel Mircophone The lapel microphone is a wireless microphone. It takes batteries, and they sometimes need replaced. Please let the Pastor / Church Office know if the betteries need replaced. Handheld Wireless Microphone The handheld microphone is a wireless microphone. It takes batteries, and they sometimes need replaced. Please let the Pastor / Church Office know if the betteries need replaced. Plug-in Mircophones There are three other plug-in microphones. Two of them are specialty designed for instruments, and the third is a regular microphone. The two music microphones are stored inside protective bags. There are various microphone cables to plug these into either stored near the sound system rack, plugged into the sound system, or near the piano/organ in Mackey Hall. Master Fader In Master Fader, the differt microphones are labelled along the bottom. Pulpit Microphone The pulpit microphone ports are combined as channel 1/2. Wireless Clip-on Lapel Mircophone The lapel microphone is channel 3. Handheld Wireless Microphone The handheld microphone is channel 4.
